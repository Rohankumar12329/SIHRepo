THE GOAL OF THIS CHALLENGE IS THE EARLY DETECTION OF SEPSIS USING PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA. THE EARLY PREDICTION OF SEPSIS IS POTENTIALLY LIFE-SAVING. SO WE WILL DEVELOP A DIGITAL SOLUTION THAT USES MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO PREDICT SEPSIS ATLEAST 6 HOUR BEFORE THE OCCURENCE OF DISEASE IN PATIENTS. INTERNATIONALLY, AN ESTIMATED 30 MILLION PEOPLE DEVELOP SEPSIS AND 6 MILLION PEOPLE DIE FROM SEPSIS EACH YEAR. EARLY DETECTION HELPS IN IMPROVING SEPSIS OUTCOMES, WHERE EACH HOUR OF DELAYED TREATMENT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ROUGHLY AN 4-8% INCREASE IN MORTALITY .


### IT IS SUCH A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO PREDICT THAT TILL NOW HIGHEST ACCURACY WHICH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IS ONLY 67.3% by [Shamim Nemati](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Nemati%20S%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=29286945 ), PhD, [Andre Holder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Holder%20A%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=29286945 ), MD, MSc, [Fereshteh Razmi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Razmi%20F%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=29286945 ), [Matthew D.
