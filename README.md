The Goal of This Challenge is the Early Detection of Sepsis Using Physiological Data. The Early Prediction of Sepsis is Potentially Life-saving. So We Will Develop a Digital Solution That Uses Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Sepsis Atleast 6 Hour Before the Occurence of Disease in Patients. Internationally, an Estimated 30 Million People Develop Sepsis and 6 Million People Die From Sepsis Each Year. Early Detection Helps in Improving Sepsis Outcomes, Where Each Hour of Delayed Treatment Has Been Associated With Roughly an 4-8% Increase in Mortality .

It is Such a Difficult Problem to Predict That Till Now Highest Accuracy Which Has Been Achieved is 67.3% by [Shamim Nemati](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Nemati%20S%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=29286945 ), PhD, [Andre Holder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Holder%20A%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=29286945 ), MD, MSc, [Fereshteh Razmi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Razmi%20F%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=29286945 ), [Matthew D.
